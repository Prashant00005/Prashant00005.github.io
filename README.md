# Analyzing Gas Emission Effects on Environment Using Sensor Data

A visualization is implemented to study the effects of hazardous gases on the environment released from four different manufacturing factories claiming to be not at fault as they follow strict guidelines and standards. These harmful effluents led to the downfall of Rose-crested Blue Pipit bird. The gas emissions are captured by multiple sensors in the vicinity and recorded by the state government. Moreover, wind direction and speed is combined with the given data to correlate with the sensor data and improve analysis. From the visualization, it is certain that the factories are not the sole reason for decline in the number of birds.
